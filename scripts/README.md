# Project support scripts

Utilities associated with the sawfish project. None of these are part of the standard sawfish runtime so they do not
need to be installed or used for any standard workflows.

- `cnv_excluded_regions` - includes scripts demonstrating how the pre-computed excluded region files were generated
- `debug` - misc utilities related to debugging sawfish
- `truvari_utils` - scripts used to process truvari ga4gh VCF outputs
